Easiest and Fastest way to configure and use **MDX** in **Nextjs 14+** or below versions also.

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language used to format text. It allows you to write using plain text syntax and convert it to structurally valid **HTML**. It's commonly used for writing content on websites and blogs.

**MDX** is a superset of markdown that lets you write **JSX** directly in your markdown files. It is a powerful way to add **dynamic interactivity** and embed **React components** within your content.

Next.js can support both **local MDX** content inside your application, as well as **remote MDX** files fetched dynamically on the server. The Next.js plugin handles transforming markdown and React components into HTML, including support for usage in Server Components (the default in App Router).
